Containerized the application with Docker

Deployed a production-grade Kubernetes cluster (EKS) with auto-scaling

Set up Prometheus + Grafana for metrics and alerts

Impact:
Reduced deployment time from 2 hours to 5 minutes

Improved deployment frequency from weekly to 5x per day

Achieved 99.99% uptime with blue/green deployments

🏥 Case Study 2: Healthcare Provider – Cloud Migration & Compliance
Client: MediCareOne (Digital health records provider)
Industry: Healthcare / HealthTech
Location: London, UK

Challenge:
Legacy infrastructure hosted on-premise made scaling and disaster recovery difficult. Client needed to meet HIPAA compliance for storing patient data.

Solution:
Migrated workloads to Microsoft Azure using Bicep templates

Used Azure DevOps pipelines to automate builds and deployments

Integrated static code analysis and security scanning into CI

Enabled auditing and access logging for compliance

Impact:
Achieved full HIPAA compliance with automated security controls

Reduced infrastructure cost by 35%

Improved system recovery time from hours to under 10 minutes

🛒 Case Study 3: E-commerce Brand – Performance & Cost Optimization
Client: StyleEdge (Online fashion retailer)
Industry: E-commerce / Retail
Location: Dubai, UAE

Challenge:
Frequent traffic spikes during sales led to outages. High AWS costs due to inefficient scaling and monitoring.

Solution:
Introduced autoscaling groups and AWS Lambda for event-driven components

Replaced legacy services with Dockerized microservices

Implemented ArgoCD for GitOps-based deployment strategy

Optimized AWS billing with cost tagging and Spot Instances

Impact:
Handled traffic spikes of 3x normal load without downtime
